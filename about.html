                <p> <q> Any person who paints whether as a profession or as a hobby is called an artist, and every artist has a special experience with art. <br>
                When it comes to me, art was and still is the only method that grants me the ability to express things that the tongue cannot say. Drawing is a deep expression of what we feel, an expression of what we have experienced or are passing through in the present. Drawing is a friend in loneliness, a friend who understands you despite your silence. </q> <br> - Moroccan rising artist Mehdi Ragani
