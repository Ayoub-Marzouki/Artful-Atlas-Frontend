                    <summary>What measures do you take to ensure the authenticity and quality of artworks?</summary>
                    <p>Before we even considered selling artworks, we've spoken to multiple printing houses and their corresponding paper expert. <br> <br> We've collected as much information as needed that are related to the quality of paper and how the very process of painting/printing on a specific type of paper is done. Next we've done some experiments on these types of papers to ensure that the given information were as accurate as they could be. <br> <br> Finally we've experimented with multiple painting brands, whether they are specified in acrylic paintings, oil paintings, gouache paintings or other types of paintings. <br>Thus, before adding an artwork to the website, we check these parameters, and, if they comply with our requirements, they are welcomed.</p>
