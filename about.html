                <p> <q> Any person who paints whether as a profession or as a hobby is called an artist, and every artist has a special experience with art. <br>
                When it comes to me, art was and still is the only method that grants me the ability to express things that the tongue cannot say. Drawing is a deep expression of what we feel, an expression of what we have experienced or are passing through in the present. Drawing is a friend in loneliness, a friend who understands you despite your silence. </q> <br> - Moroccan rising artist Mehdi Ragani

                        <p>Before we even considered selling artworks, we've spoken to multiple printing houses and their corresponding paper expert. We've collected as much information as needed that are related to the quality of paper and how the very process of painting/printing on a specific type of paper is done. Next we've done some experiments on these types of papers to ensure that the given information were as accurate as they could be. Finally we've experimented with multiple painting brands, whether they are specified in acrylic paintings, oil paintings, gouache paintings or other types of paintings. <br>Thus, before adding an artwork to the website, we check these parameters, and, if they comply with our requirements, they are welcomed.</p>
